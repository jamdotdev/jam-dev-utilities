        <h2>Understanding Your Speed Test Results</h2>
        <p>
          Internet speed tests measure several key metrics that affect your
          online experience. Understanding these metrics helps you determine if
          your connection meets your needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Download Speed:</b> <br />
            How fast data transfers from the internet to your device. Important
            for streaming, downloading files, and web browsing. Measured in Mbps
            (megabits per second).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Upload Speed:</b> <br />
            How fast data transfers from your device to the internet. Critical
            for video calls, uploading files, and live streaming. Usually slower
            than download speed for most connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Latency (Ping):</b> <br />
            The time it takes for data to travel to a server and back. Lower
            latency means more responsive connections. Measured in milliseconds
            (ms). Important for gaming and video calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Jitter:</b> <br />
            The variation in latency over time. Lower jitter means more stable
            connections. High jitter can cause issues with real-time
            applications like gaming and video calls.

        <h2>Internet Speed Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Different online activities require different internet speeds. Here's
          what you need for common activities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Basic web browsing and email:</b> 1-5 Mbps
          </li>

            <b>Online gaming:</b> 3-6 Mbps (with low latency)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Video calls:</b> 1-8 Mbps
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Large file downloads:</b> 50+ Mbps
          </li>

        <h2>Why Use Cloudflare Speed Test?</h2>
        <p>
          Our speed test uses Cloudflare's global network, which provides more
          accurate results than traditional speed tests. Cloudflare has servers
          in over 200 cities worldwide, so you're likely testing against a
          server close to your location.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test is performed directly in your browser using modern web APIs,
          ensuring accurate measurements of your actual browsing experience. No
          plugins or software installations required.

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>How accurate is this speed test?</b> <br />
            Our speed test uses Cloudflare's global CDN network, providing
            highly accurate results by testing against servers close to your
            location. Results reflect real-world browsing performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Why might my speed test results vary?</b> <br />
            Internet speeds can vary due to network congestion, time of day,
            your device's performance, background applications, and your ISP's
            current load. Run multiple tests for the most accurate average.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Should I close other applications before testing?</b> <br />
            For the most accurate results, close applications that use the
            internet (streaming, downloads, cloud sync) during the test. This
            ensures the test measures your connection's full capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What's a good internet speed?</b> <br />
            It depends on your usage. For basic browsing: 5-10 Mbps. For HD
            streaming: 25+ Mbps. For multiple users or 4K streaming: 50+ Mbps.
            For heavy usage or multiple devices: 100+ Mbps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Why is my upload speed slower than download?</b> <br />
            Most internet plans are asymmetric, providing faster download than
            upload speeds. This is because most users download more data
            (streaming, browsing) than they upload.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Is this speed test free?</b> <br />
            Yes, completely free with no registration required. No ads, no
            tracking, and open source. Just like all our developer utilities at
            Jam.
