        <h2>Understanding QR Code Error Correction:</h2>
        <p>
          QR codes include built-in error correction that allows them to be read
          even when partially damaged or obscured. This feature is particularly
          important when adding logos:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Low (L) ~7%:</b> Smallest QR code size, but less tolerance for
            logos and damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Medium (M) ~15%:</b> Good balance between size and error
            tolerance. Default for most applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Quartile (Q) ~25%:</b> Better for noisy environments and small
            logos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>High (H) ~30%:</b> Best choice when adding logos or expecting
            damage. Larger file size but maximum customization capability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>QR Code Best Practices:</h2>
        <p>
          Follow these guidelines to create effective and scannable QR codes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Adequate Size:</b> Ensure your QR code is at least 2 x 2 cm (0.8
            x 0.8 inches) when printed to maintain scannability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>High Contrast:</b> Use high contrast between foreground and
            background colors for better readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Logo Size:</b> Keep logos under 20% of the QR code area to
            maintain scannability, especially with lower error correction
            levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Test Scanning:</b> Always test your QR codes with multiple
            devices and scanning apps before final use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Clear Instructions:</b> Include clear call-to-action text like
            "Scan to visit website" near your QR code.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Working with QR Codes in JavaScript:</h2>
        <p>
          You can generate and work with QR codes programmatically using
          JavaScript libraries. Here's an example using a popular QR code
          library:
        </p>
        <CodeExample>{qrCodeExample}</CodeExample>
        <p>
          This code demonstrates basic QR code generation. For advanced features
          like custom styling and logos, consider using specialized libraries
          like qr-code-styling or similar tools.

        <h2>FAQs:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Can I add a logo to my QR code?</b> <br /> Yes! Our generator
            allows you to upload and embed logos in the center of your QR code.
            Use high error correction (H level) for best results with logos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What file formats can I download?</b> <br /> You can download
            your QR code as PNG, SVG, JPEG, or WebP. SVG is recommended for
            print materials as it's vector-based and scalable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>How do I ensure my QR code scans properly?</b> <br /> Use high
            contrast colors, maintain adequate size (minimum 2x2 cm when
            printed), test with multiple devices, and avoid making logos too
            large.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What's the difference between error correction levels?</b> <br />
            Higher levels (Q, H) can recover from more damage and allow larger
            logos but create bigger QR codes. Lower levels (L, M) create smaller
            codes but are less tolerant of damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Can I change the shape of QR code elements?</b> <br /> Yes!
            Choose from squares, dots, rounded corners, and other stylish
            options to match your brand while maintaining scannability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Is this QR code generator free?</b> <br /> Yes, our QR code
            generator is completely free with no limits on usage. Generate as
            many customized QR codes as you need.
