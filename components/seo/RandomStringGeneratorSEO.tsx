        <h2>Why use a Random String Generator?</h2>
        <p>
          Manually created strings are often predictable and easy to guess. A
          random string generator helps you avoid common patterns and ensures
          your generated strings are cryptographically secure.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Security:</b> <br /> Random, unpredictable strings are harder to
            crack or guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Customization:</b> <br /> Adjust the length and character sets to
            meet your application requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Convenience:</b> <br /> Generate reliable random strings
            instantly, perfect for API keys, tokens, or secure identifiers.
          </li>
