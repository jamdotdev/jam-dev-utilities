        <h2>Why Use a Password Generator?</h2>
        <p>
          Manually created passwords are often weak and easy to guess. A
          password generator helps you avoid common mistakes and ensures your
          credentials are strong.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Security:</b> <br /> Random, unpredictable passwords are harder
            to crack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Customization:</b> <br /> Adjust the length and types of
            characters to meet site requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
