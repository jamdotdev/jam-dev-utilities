## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. Ensure you have Node.js 20.9.0 installed.
2. That's it, you're ready to go!

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamdotdev/jam-dev-utilities.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd jam-dev-utilities
```

For macOS users with ARM architecture (M series processors), it's crucial to install these dependencies using `brew` to ensure full compatibility with the `node-canvas` library. This step is essential to prevent potential failures during the `npm install` process.

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can find it at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman python-setuptools
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
